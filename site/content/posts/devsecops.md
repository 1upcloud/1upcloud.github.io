In the world of continuous integration and delivery, security is no longer a standalone process. DevSecOps integrates security directly into the development pipeline. As companies face increasing cyber threats, adopting a robust DevSecOps strategy is crucial. 

> **DevSecOps** brings security to the forefront, embedding it into every stage of development, from code writing to deployment.

### The Need for Speed and Security

With the rise of agile methodologies, speed is of the essence, but security can't be compromised. DevSecOps enables teams to achieve both:

1. **Automated security checks** in CI/CD pipelines.
2. **Vulnerability scanning** at every stage.
3. **Enhanced collaboration** between developers, operations, and security teams.

### A Real-World Example

Imagine a team using Jenkins for CI/CD. By integrating tools like OWASP ZAP, security scans become an automated part of the build process, catching vulnerabilities early and reducing time to production.
