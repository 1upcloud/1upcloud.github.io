The client’s legal team was overwhelmed with repetitive contract review tasks—NDA verification, clause extraction, renewal alerts, and risk classification. They also needed to keep the data on-premises due to regulatory requirements (FINRA and SOC2 compliance), ruling out public SaaS LLMs.

Solution:
1UpCloud deployed a private Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture using:

Mistral 7B fine-tuned on legal clause datasets.

LangChain to orchestrate document parsing, vector search, and summarization.

ChromaDB as a fast vector store for over 1 million pages.

A lightweight streamlit-based internal UI for contract upload and real-time question answering.

Hosted securely on GPU-backed RHEL EC2 instances in a FedRAMP-compliant AWS GovCloud VPC.

We containerized the app using Docker and deployed it with Kubernetes for scalability. GitHub Actions + ArgoCD were used for CI/CD, while observability was handled with Grafana and Loki.

Results:
~85% reduction in manual review time for standard NDAs and contracts.

90%+ accuracy in identifying key clauses like indemnity, renewal dates, and payment terms.

Fully air-gapped architecture ensured compliance with internal and federal data privacy policies.

Delivered a custom LLM chatbot that responded to user queries like “Show me the auto-renewal clause in this document” in under 2 seconds.

Impact:
The legal team was able to shift from reactive reviews to proactive risk analysis. The tool is now being extended to procurement and compliance departments. A potential cost savings of $400K+ annually was projected through labor optimization alone.
