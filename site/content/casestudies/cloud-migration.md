FastRetail faced frequent server downtimes during high traffic events, such as sales and holiday seasons, leading to lost revenue and customer dissatisfaction. Their on-premise infrastructure was rigid, expensive to maintain, and lacked the agility to scale with their growth.  

**Solution:**  
Our team designed a cloud migration strategy tailored to their needs:  
1. **Cloud Platform Selection:** Migrated their e-commerce platform to AWS using a microservices architecture.  
2. **Auto-Scaling Solutions:** Implemented auto-scaling groups to handle traffic spikes dynamically.  
3. **Cost Optimization:** Leveraged reserved instances and spot instances to reduce operational costs by 35%.  
4. **Disaster Recovery:** Deployed multi-region backups and an automated failover mechanism.  

**Results:**  
- 99.99% uptime during peak traffic.  
- Improved page load times by 40%, boosting conversion rates.  
- Reduced infrastructure costs by 30% annually.
